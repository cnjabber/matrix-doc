# Matrix Projects
We are using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the [try matrix now](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) page and the project pages.

Feel free to send us a PR to add or update a project entry. You can start with the [template](./template.md), and you can upload a thumbnail and/or a main picture to the [images](./images/) subfolder - these will be accessible from https://matrix.org/docs/projects/images/

Jekyll requires a date in the project filename; we use the date to sort the various project lists (oldest projects first). Please submit new entries with the starting date of the project.
