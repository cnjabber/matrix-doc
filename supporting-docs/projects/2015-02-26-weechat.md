[WeeChat](http://weechat.org/) is a super powerful CLI chat client that is extensible in many languages to allow for new protocols like Matrix. @torhve contributed this great WeeChat script for Matrix which is getting a good feedback from more geeky users.

To use it, you will need to sign up for a Matrix account on a server using the [Console Web](./matrix-console.html) or [Vector](./vector.html) clients, as WeeChat doesnâ€™t support registration yet.

To run it, grab the code from [@torhve's github repo](https://github.com/torhve/weechat-matrix-protocol-script).
