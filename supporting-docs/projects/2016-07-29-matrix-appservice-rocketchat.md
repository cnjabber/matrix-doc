# {{ page.title }}
This project bridges [Rocket Chat](https://rocket.chat) to Matrix. This uses Rocket Chat's webhooks directly (there is also a Hubot-solution - see the [Rocket Chat federation](http://matrix.org/docs/projects/as/rocket-chat-federation.html) project).

Get it from [github](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-rocketchat).
