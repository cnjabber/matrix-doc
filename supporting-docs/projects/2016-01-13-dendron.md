# {{ page.title }}
Dendron is a Matrix homeserver written in Go.

Rather than write a Matrix homeserver from scratch, Dendron acts as a proxy for an existing homeserver Synapse written in python. This means that it can be already be used as a fully-featured homeserver.

Check it out on [github](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron)!
